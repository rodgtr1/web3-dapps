# CRUD

### A simple crud app on the blockchain.

<br />

#### GETTING STARTED
1. Run npm install.
2. To run tests use ```truffle test``` (if you don't have truffle then run ```npm install -g truffle``` to install it).
3.  Enter your project ID from Infura (you'll need an account. Be sure to choose the Ropsten network) and your seed phrase (see below) in a *.secrets* file (copy the .secrets-example for a template).
4. Run truffle develop to generate a seed phrase/addresses. In that develop terminal run ```migrate --reset --network ropsten``` to run your migrations and build/deploy your project. Be sure to have some test ether in order to deploy and make transactions.
5. Run ```npm run start``` to run app. You can Create, Read, Update, and Delete users on the Ropsten network using the Metamask wallet and the Ropsten network.

Obviously functionality is the focus here, not style ðŸ¤ª
